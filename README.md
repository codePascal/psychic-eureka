# psychic-eureka

Contains solutions to Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

To run a program, simply run

`bash run.sh i`

where `i` denotes the project number.

Solved projects have the correct answer written to the description. If you try
to run problems that are not implemented yet, a `NotImplementedError` will be
raised.
